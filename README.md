Collection of Python functions for prediction of turbulence-flat plate interaction noise using Amiet's model

This file provides a series of functions in Python language developed for studying the noise generated by isotropic turbulence interacting with a flat plate aerofoil. It uses Amiet's [1975] linearized model, and is capable of predicting the unsteady surface pressure developed over the aerofoil and the acoustic radiation emmitted by it. Other capabilities include the modeling of convection and refraction effects on sound propagation to model acoustic measurements performed in a closed- or open-jet wind tunnel.

These codes were originally written by Fabio Casagrande Hirono between 2014 and 2018, while studying for a PhD degree in Acoustical Engineering at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR), University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.
