- [ ] Add code to analyse airfoil surface pressure (Sqq magnitude, relative phase, coherence)
  - [ ] Take from codes used in PhD thesis

- [ ] Add code to encapsulate simulated array CSM in HDF5 format
  - [ ] See Acoular for references?

- [ ] Add code to compare mic array predictions to measurements (PSD, CSD rel. phase, coherence)
  - [ ] Take from codes used in PhD thesis
  
- [ ] Add code to simulate corner sources at airfoil junction with side plates
  - [ ] Estimate corner source levels from integration of beamforming maps (measured data)
